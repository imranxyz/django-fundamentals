## Installation & Configuration

It is highly recommend that to install most recent stable version of django. Latest version may not be stable.

**Install Django ü§ûüèª**

* `pip install django`
    * latest version will be installed
* `pip install django==x.x.x`
    * Specfic version will be installed

**Check Django is installed or not ü§ûüèª**

* `python -m django --version`

To work with django first we've to understand  `django project` and `django application` terminology.

* Django project is a group of applications and configuration information.
    * Bank Project
        * Customer Application
        * Loan Application
        * Marketing Application
        * Insurence Application
* Application is responsible to perform particular task.

**Create Django Project ü§û**

* To create django project first you've to type `django-admin startproject ProjectName`
* After run this command django project structured will be look like this
    * ![django-project-structure](https://cutt.ly/VCxYFjz)
* Application is responsible to perform particular task.
    * `python manage.py startapp AppName`
    * ![django-app-structure](https://cutt.ly/6CYaiCq)
* Web server provides environment to run the the application.
    * to run the server type `python manage.py runserver`. Default server is `127.0.0.1:8000` but we can change the port also by typing `python manage.py runserver xxxx`

**Steps to Develop a Django Project ü§û**

* Create Project
* Create Application
* Install an application in the `settings.py` file
* Create view function in `views.py` to provide response
    * Every view function takes `request` as an input & return `response` as output.
* Define urlpattern for view function in `urls.py` file.
    * For every view function we've to provide separate urlpattern
    * By using this urlpattern user can send request.
* Run server
* Send the request

**How Server Response a Request ü§ûüèª**

`127.0.0.1:8000/movies`

* First server will get requested via urlpattern
* Server opens `urls.py` file
* Server identifes the corresponding view function from `urls.py` file
* Server will execute the `view(model, template)` function and return response to the user
